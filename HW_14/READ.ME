# Differential Expression Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This assignment involves performing a differential expression analysis on a count matrix to identify genes that show significant changes in expression levels between different conditions (e.g., control vs. treatment). The analysis includes generating visualizations such as PCA plots and heatmaps to interpret the results.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess a count matrix.
- Perform differential expression analysis using statistical models.
- Identify significant genes based on adjusted p-values.
- Visualize the results using PCA and heatmaps.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - statsmodels
  - sklearn

## Steps
1. **Load Required Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Load Count Matrix**: Read the count matrix from a CSV file.
3. **Prepare Data for Analysis**: Define sample conditions for comparison.
4. **Perform Differential Expression Analysis**: Fit a statistical model to identify significant genes.
5. **PCA Plot**: Generate a PCA plot to visualize sample clustering.
6. **Heatmap of Significant Genes**: Create a heatmap to display expression levels of significant genes.

## Results
- Approximately **200** significant genes identified.
- Upregulated genes show expression levels of **9231** in treatment samples compared to **4070** in control samples.
- Downregulated genes may show expression levels of **2854** in treatment samples versus **7665** in control samples.
- PCA plot showing **60-80%** variance explained by the first two components.
- Heatmap indicating clusters of upregulated and downregulated genes.
