# Design Document for Differential Expression Analysis

##  Introduction
This document outlines the design and implementation details for conducting differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq data. The goal is to identify genes that exhibit significant changes in expression levels between different conditions (e.g., control vs. treatment).

##  Objectives
- To preprocess and analyze RNA-Seq count data.
- To identify significant differentially expressed genes.
- To visualize results through PCA and heatmaps.

## Components:
###  Data Input
- **Input Format**: A CSV file containing the count matrix with rows representing genes and columns representing different samples.
- **Example Structure**:
###  Data Processing
- **Loading Data**: Use `pandas` to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
- **Normalization**: Apply normalization techniques (e.g., TPM, RPKM) to account for differences in sequencing depth.
- **Filtering**: Remove lowly expressed genes based on a defined threshold.
###  Statistical Analysis
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Use statistical models (e.g., negative binomial distribution) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes.
- **Significance Threshold**: Adjust p-values using methods like Benjamini-Hochberg to control the false discovery rate.
###  Visualization
- **PCA Plot**: Generate a PCA plot to visualize the clustering of samples based on gene expression.
- **Heatmap**: Create a heatmap to display expression levels of significant genes, highlighting upregulated and downregulated genes.

##  Workflow
1. **Load Required Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.
2. **Load Count Matrix**: Read the count matrix from a CSV file using `pandas`.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Normalize and filter the data to prepare for analysis.
4. **Perform Differential Expression Analysis**: Fit a statistical model to identify significant genes.
5. **Generate Visualizations**: Create PCA plots and heatmaps to interpret the results.
6. **Output Results**: Save significant genes and visualizations for reporting.

##  Outcomes
- Identification of approximately **50-200** significant genes.
- Visualizations that clearly depict the differences in gene expression between conditions.
- A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
tematic approach to identifying key genes involved in biological processes influenced by treatment conditions.
