3- What flags will make the ls command write out the files sizes in “human-friendly” mode?

ls -lh


4- What flag will make the rm command ask for permission when removing a file?

rm -i 


5- Create a nested directory structure. Make files in the various directories.

mkdir -p ~/projects/{project1/{src,bin},project2/{docs,tests}}
touch ~/projects/project1/src/main.c
touch ~/projects/project1/bin/executable
touch ~/projects/project2/docs/readme.txt
touch ~/projects/project2/tests/test_main.c

projects/
├── project1/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── main.c
│   └── bin/
│       └── executable
└── project2/
    ├── docs/
    │   └── readme.txt
    └── tests/
        └── test_main.c



6- List the absolute and relative path to a file.

Absolute Path:
/home/username/projects/project1/src/main.c

Relative Path:
projects/project1/src/main.c (from the home directory)


7- List a valid path with shortcuts: home directory, current directory, parent directory. 

Home Directory:
~/documents/report.txt

Current Directory:
./projects/project1/src/main.c

Parent Directory:
../backup/old_files/
