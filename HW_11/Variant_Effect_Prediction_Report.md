## Example Variants
|Chromosome	 | Position	  | Reference  | Alternate  |  Effect	     | Impact   |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
|chr1	       | 245683     |      A	   |    T	      |  Missense	   | High     |
|chr2	       | 243762     |      G	   |    C	      |  Synonymous  | Moderate |
|chr3        | 345671     |      C     |    G       |   Nonsens    | Low      |


## Interpretation
High Impact Variants: These variants are likely to have significant effects on gene function and may be associated with disease phenotypes.
Moderate Impact Variants: These variants may have moderate effects on gene function and could contribute to phenotypic variation.
Low Impact Variants: These variants are likely to have minimal effects on gene function but could still be of interest in certain contexts.
