# E. coli Variant Calling Analysis

## Introduction

This report outlines the steps and results of the E. coli variant calling analysis.

## Methods

The following steps were performed:

* Variant calling using bcftools
* Filtering of variants based on quality score and depth of coverage
* Annotation of variants with gene names and functional predictions
* Visualization of variants in a graphical interface

## Results

The variant calling process identified [insert number] variants.

The filtered variants are listed in the table below:

| Chromosome | Position | Reference | Alternate | Quality Score | Depth of Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```
To generate the report, run the following command:
```bash
make
```
This will create the `report.md` file with the contents of the Markdown report.

To view the report, run the following command:
```bash
cat report.md
```
This will display the contents of the report in the terminal.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed with the analysis!
