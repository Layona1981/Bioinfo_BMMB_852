##### Sequence Ontology: Exon

####### Definition
An **exon** is a region of a gene that is included in the mature RNA transcript after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.

##### Parent Terms
- **region**: A sequence feature that is a continuous interval of sequence.
- **gene_member_region**: A region that is part of a gene.

##### Children Nodes
- **five_prime_exon**: An exon that is at the 5' end of a transcript.
- **three_prime_exon**: An exon that is at the 3' end of a transcript.
- **internal_exon**: An exon that is neither at the 5' nor the 3' end of a transcript.

##### Discussion
The term **"exon"** is fundamental in the context of gene structure and function. Exons are the coding regions of genes that are transcribed into mRNA and then translated into proteins. The identification of exons is crucial for understanding gene expression and regulation. The parent terms "region" and "gene_member_region" place exons within the broader context of genomic features, while the children nodes specify the position of exons within the transcript, highlighting their role in the splicing process.
