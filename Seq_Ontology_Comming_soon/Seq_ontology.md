##### Definition of "Exon" 

- **Term**: Exon
- **SO Accession**: SO:0000147
- **Definition**: An exon is a sequence region of a gene that is transcribed and remains present in the mature RNA product after introns are removed by RNA splicing.


#### Parent Terms of "Exon"

1. **Sequence Feature (SO:0000110)**: This is a broad category that includes any region of biological sequence.
2. **Region (SO:0000001)**: A general term for any continuous sequence of nucleotides.
3. **Transcript Region (SO:0000833)**: A part of a transcript, which is an RNA molecule transcribed from DNA.

#### Children Nodes of "Exon"

1. **Five Prime Exon (SO:0000204)**: An exon located at the 5' end of a transcript.
2. **Three Prime Exon (SO:0000205)**: An exon located at the 3' end of a transcript.
3. **Internal Exon (SO:0000196)**: An exon located between the first and last exon of a transcript.
4. **Coding Exon (SO:0000195)**: An exon that contains coding sequence.

### Discussion

 Exons are the coding portions of a gene that are expressed in the final mRNA product. Understanding the hierarchy of terms in the Sequence Ontology helps in annotating genomic features accurately.

- **Parent Terms**: The exons are specific types of sequence features that contribute to the structure of transcripts. This hierarchical structure reflects the biological organization, where exons are integral parts of larger transcript regions and sequence features.

- **Children Nodes**: The diversity of exon types based on their position within a transcript. For example, five prime and three prime exons are crucial for understanding the regulation of gene expression, as they often contain untranslated regions (UTRs) that play roles in mRNA stability and translation efficiency.
