### Results

***Initial Quality Control***
The initial quality control report indicated several issues with the sequencing data, including low-quality scores and adapter contamination.

***Quality Improvement***
After trimming, the quality of the reads improved significantly, as evidenced by higher quality scores and the removal of adapter sequences.

***Post-Improvement Quality Control***
The post-improvement quality control report showed that the quality of the reads was much better, with fewer low-quality bases and no adapter contamination.
