Organism name: Accipiter nisus. 

1- Tell us a bit about the organism.
Accipiter nisus is the scientific name of (Northern Goshawk) bird. Lives in forests across Europe, Asia, and North America.  It is an agile top predator that plays an important role in its ecosystem. 

2- How many features does the file contain?
  867929

3-How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? 
 44975

4-How many genes are listed for this organism?
45991

5-What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
309995 exon
301420 CDS
133065 biological_region
44975 region
27007 mRNA
18324 five_prime_UTR
17271 gene
14159 three_prime_UTR
 754 ncRNA_gene
 433 lnc_RNA

6-Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?

The high number of features indicates a rich annotation. Multiple sequence regions also suggest a complete genome. In addition, the diverse types of features imply a well-annotated genome. 

Here are the commands I used to generate my answers: 

First, to  download the file I used:   curl -O https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/accipiter_nisus/Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3.gz

To extract the GFF file I used: gunzip Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3.gz

To answer Q2- I used: $ grep -v '^#' Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3 | wc -l

For Q3- I used: $ grep -v '^#' Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3 | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l 

For Q4- I used: grep -v '^#' Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3 | grep -c 'gene'

For Q5- I used: grep -v '^#' Accipiter_nisus.Accipiter_nisus_ver1.0.112.gff3 | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
