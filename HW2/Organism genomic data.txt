# Organism Information

**Organism name**: Accipiter nisus

## 1. Tell us a bit about the organism.
Accipiter nisus is the scientific name of the Northern Goshawk bird. It lives in forests across Europe, Asia, and North America. It is an agile top predator that plays an important role in its ecosystem.

## 2. How many features does the file contain?
**Output**: 867929 

## 3. How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain?
**Output**: 44975

## 4. How many genes are listed for this organism?
**Output**: 45991

## 5. What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
| Feature Type          | Count   |
|-----------------------|---------|
| exon                  | 309995  |
| CDS                   | 301420  |
| biological_region     | 133065  |
| region                | 44975   |
| mRNA                  | 27007   |
| five_prime_UTR       | 18324   |
| gene                  | 17271   |
| three_prime_UTR      | 14159   |
| ncRNA_gene            | 754     |
| lnc_RNA               | 433     |

## 6. Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?
The high number of features indicates a rich annotation. Multiple sequence regions also suggest a complete genome. In addition, the diverse types of features imply a well-annotated genome.
