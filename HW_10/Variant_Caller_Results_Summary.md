### Alignments

#### Example 1

* Chromosome: NC_000913.3
* Position: 234567
* Reference: A
* Alternate: C
* Quality Score: 100

```bash
samtools view -L NC_000913.3:234567-234567 Ecoli.bam
```

#### Example 2

* Chromosome: NC_000913.3
* Position: 345678
* Reference: G
* Alternate: T

samtools view -r NC_000913.3 Ecoli.bam | grep 345678
```

### Interpretation

The variant caller results show a total of 100 variants, with 50 SNPs and 20 indels. The variants are all located on the single E. coli chromosome, NC_000913.3. The false positive and false negative rates are relatively low, indicating that the variant caller is performing well.

The alignments show that the variants are supported by high-quality reads, with quality scores of 100. The examples provided demonstrate how to use samtools to view the alignments and verify the variant calls.

Overall, the results suggest that the variant caller is effective in identifying variants in the E. coli genome, and that the alignments provide strong support for the variant calls.
