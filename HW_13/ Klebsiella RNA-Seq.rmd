# Design Document for Klebsiella RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline

## Purpose
The purpose of this pipeline is to analyze RNA-Seq data from Klebsiella to generate a count matrix that summarizes read counts across multiple datasets.

## Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download RNA-Seq data from SRA.
2. **Preprocessing**: Align reads to the reference genome.
3. **Quantification**: Count reads associated with genes.
4. **Analysis**: Load and analyze the count matrix in R.

## Data Flow
- **Input**: Raw FASTQ files from SRA.
- **Processing**:
  - Alignment using HISAT2.
  - Conversion to BAM format using SAMtools.
  - Counting features using FeatureCounts.
- **Output**: Count matrix summarizing gene expression levels.

## Visualization
Screenshots from IGV will be included to validate the RNA-Seq data.
